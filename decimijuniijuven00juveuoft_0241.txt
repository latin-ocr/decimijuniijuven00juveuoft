PER. SAT. 1. 2:33

here reprehended.—Atcin .· (the name is variously written) a
Phrygian shepherd, beloved by Cybele—Berecynthio: ‘from
Berecynthus,’ a mountain of Phrygia.——.Nerea: for mare—Del-
phin: most think, the allusion is to the story of Arion, who,
having been thrown overboard, was carried safe to land on the
back of a delphin. ι

95. Sic .· sc. didicit claudere mmmm—Cosmum this line is
ridiculous on account of the attempt at rhyme in longo and ,Apen-
nino, the spondajc conclusion, and the strange expression of
Hannibal‘s removing a rib from the Apennines‚ instead of opening
a passage for his army with fire and vinegar. Juv. X, 152.—It .
is thus translated by Drummond: ’

Where from the broad-bucked niounlain's monstrous chine.
The hero carves a rib os Apennine.

96. Arma . . . coctum .· commentators explain this passage dif-
ferentlyz—the adversary, with whom Persius supposes he is
conver-sing, compares the poets of his time with virgil, and
quoting part of the first line of the AEneid‚ asks, if that is not
written in an inflated and rugged manner. Persius, in his an-
swer‚ ironically chimes in with the adversary.—The cork-tree
has two barks--the outer, which is much thicker than the inner
one, should be removed at certain seasons of the year. If this
is not done, the outer bark burste and makes the surface of the
tree very rough: Persius therefore says, Virgil is like an old
branch of a large cork-tree‚ the outer bark of which has not been
removed at the proper season, but has become withered up with
age and dried up by the heat of the sun, which is the meaning of
coctum—Another way in which it is understood is this 3—Per·
sius, in the 96th verse, asks if the verses before quoted do not flow
smoothly and lightly like foam and bark upon the surface of
water3 to render this more ridiculous, he swears by the AEneid
of virgil (arma virum). In the next linc, he enswers his own
question and says, ut ramale, &tu

98. Quidnam . . . legendum .· some understand this question to
be proposed by Persius, to which the adversar-y replies by a
quotation from the poems of (as most critics think) N era—Others
understand the question to be proposed by the adversary, to
which Persius, deriding the querist, replies by a quotation, &cz—-
Larci cervice: ‘with an inclined head-in a languishing and
tender manner?

99. Mimalloneis .· the Mimallones were priestesses of Bacchus,
so called from Mimas, a mountain of Ionia, sacred to Bacchus.

b 100. Vitulo superbo .· by these words, Pentheus is thought to

e meant.

101. Bassaris.- Agare, the mother of Pentheus, a priestess
of Bacchus, thus called from Bassareus‚ a name of Bacchus.
——Izyncem the car of Bacchus was sablcd to be drawn by
