146 NOTES.

this turbot was so large, that a dish could not be found to con-
tain it.

72. Quos . . . amicitiae: we have here a striking representa-
tion of a tyrant, who, conscious of being hated by all, hates them;
and they, knowing his capricious cruelty, never approach him,
without horror and dread, lest they should say or do- something,
however undesignedly, which may cost them their lives.

Γ74. Liburno : ‘a Liburnian slave,’ who discharged the office
o a crier.

75. Rapta.. . Urbi.- abolla here signifies either a philoso-
pher’s robe, as Pegasus was a stoic 3 or the robe of office, which
he wore as prcesectis urbis.

76. Pegasus .- an eminent lawyer who had been appointed pre-
fect of the city of Rome : he is here called villicus, bailiff of the
city, signifying that the chief magistrate of Rome, in consequence
of the tyranny of Domitian, had now no more power or dignity,
than the paltry offieer of a country village.

77. Optimus . . ,justitia .· i. e. Pegasus was a very excellent
magistrate, yet such was the arbitrary power of Domitian, that
he dai-ed not act according to the dictatos os his heart.

79. Incrm‘ijustilz‘d .- justice is said to be unarmed, when judges
and high officers act contrary to conscience.

80. Venit . . . senectus ·'. ‘the old facetious Crispus comes too?

86. Cum quo . . . amici: it was not safe for Domitian's friends
to converse with him, even on the most trivial subjects, such as
the state of the weather, &c., if they did not agree in sentiment
with him.

92. His . . ‚fistinata .· many texts have a period aster auh), his,
διο. applying to Crispus .· Ruperti has a period aster solstitia, un-
derstanding his, &c. to apply to Acilius—The construction is,
Acilius, qui his quoque armis erat Intus iu illd aulo (i. e. of Do-
mitian), et qni erat ejusdem (etatis (i. e. as Crispus) properabat
proxim-ns cum jurene (i. e. his son Domitius, as this is generally
understood3 see line 93, (note) indigno, διο.

93. Acilius . . . cum juvene : Acilius Glabrio, a senator of sin-
gular prudence and fidelity ; his son Domitius came with him to
this conneil3 bnt both of them were shortly after charged with
designs against the emperor, and were condemned to death.
The father's sentence was changed to banishmen't, that he might
be the inore tortured by the remembrance of his son's death.
The son, to save his life, affected madness and fought naked with
lions in the Alban theatre: the tyrant was not to be deceived,
but put him to death.

97. ⁴Malim . . . gffgantis : i. e. since noble birth is dangerouS, I
had rather claim no higher kindred than my parent earth, and
though not in sim, yet, as to origin, be a brother of the earth-
born giants- than be descended from a noble race.

101. Quas . . . [uum .· there are none, in these days, who would
