163. Qui . . . orbem.- this passage is explained in several
different ways3 one is, ‘Who rinses his mouth with wine, and
spits it upon the splendid pavement.’—-Lacedaemonium . . . orbem .-
the. Romans were very fond of fine pavements or floors, made of
marble and inlaid with various kinds of it; among the rest, some
kinds of marble were brought from Sparta, in small round forms,
which were inserted in their proper places by way of ornament.

179. Interea.- i. e. while we are feasting.-Megalesiacae . . .
mappoe .· at the Circensian and Megalesion games‚ they hung out
a towel, to show that the sports were about to begin. Nero in-
troduced this cust01n3 for, hearing as he sat at dinner, how im-
patiently the people expected his coming, he threw out at the
window the towel with which he wiped his hands, to give the
people notice that he had dined‚ and would soon be at the circus.
From that time, the beginning of the games was announced by
hanging outa towel. The Megalesian games were in honor of
Cybele, who was called Idaean, from Ida, a mountain of Phrygia,
where she was worshipped: hence her festival was called Idoeum
solenne.

184. Viridis . . . panni .· the four parties, which ran chariot-
races in the circus, were dressed in different liveries, viz· green,
russet, blue, and white. One of these parties was always favored
by the court, and, at this time, most probably, the green.

192. Togam: i. e. the low Romans, crowding to the games.
See Sat. I, 88.—Balnea . . . sextam: the Romans attended to
their usual business, till noon, that is, the sixth hour, and then, to
the ninth hour, or three o'clock in the asternoon, they exercised
and bathed themselves, and then went to their meals.

To do these sooner than the appointed 'hours was allowed
only on festival days, or to persons aged and infirm. To be seen
gging to the baths before the appointed hour, was reckoned
e eminate.

194. Facere hoc .· i. e. frequent feasts and indulge in idleness.

195. Talis .· i. e. voluptuous and idle.

196. Voluptates . . . usus.- thus Plin. XII, 17. Τὸ γὰρ ἡδύ, ἐὰν

πολύ, ὀύ τι γε 261:

SATIRE ΧΙΙ.

The poet, having invited Corvinus to assist at a sacrifice, which
he intended to offer up by way of thanksgiving for the safety
of his friend Catullus from the dangers of the seas, professes
his disinterestedness on the occasion, and from thence takes an
opportunity to satirize the Haeridepetae, or legacy-hunters, who
flattered and paid their court to rich men, in hopes of becoming
their heirs.
