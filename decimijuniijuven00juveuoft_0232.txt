SATIRE XVI.

This Satire is supposed to have been written by Juvenal, while
lie commanded in Egypt: he sets forth, ironically, the advan-
tages and privileges of the soldiery, and how happy they are be-
yond others, whom he mentions, while, 111 reality, 116 15 satirizing
their extreme licentiousness and iusolence.

Many have thought that this Satire was not written by Ju-
venal. γ

ed and called Bardaicus calceus et grandes surae ,· that is, one
whose great legs are covered with military boots is appointed
judge, &c— Calceus probably means here the caliga, which was
a sort of harness for the foot and leg.

The complainant 15 referred to a military Judge, who takes his
seat on the henchin a military dress.
