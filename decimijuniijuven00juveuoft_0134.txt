tangle his adversary by casting it over his head, and suddenly
drawing it together, and then with his lance he usually slew him.
If he missed his aim, by either throwing the net too short or too
far, he instantly fied, and endeavored to prepare his net for a
second thr0w‚ while his antagonist swiftly pursucd, to prevent his
design, by slaying him.
