SATIRE IX.

This Satire consists of a dialogue between Juvenal and Nae-
volus, an enfranchised slave ; a poor wretch, who, from a kind of
jester or dabbler in small wit for a meal, had become what is
called a man of plens-are 3 and thence, by a regular gradatim, a
dependant of some wealthy debauchee (here named Virro), who
made him subservierit to liis unnatural passions: and, in return,
starveih insulted‚ hated, despised, and di÷carded him. This
miserable object the poet rallies with infinite spirit, on his dis-
cousolate appearance 3 and, by an affected ignorance ofthe cause,
engages him to enter into a detailed account of his infamous life.

3. Crepereius Pollio .· the name of some noted spendthrift.

7. Vei-nam equitem .· slaves, who appeared in a style and man-
ner above their condition, were called verme equites, gentlemen-

8. salibus . . . intra pomoen'a: ‘jests of a polished kind‚’ in
contradistinction to the provincial low-born jests of the common
slaves—pomarium (quasi post murum) was a space about the
walls ofa town, within and without, where it was not lawful to
plough or build for fear of hindering the defence of the city:
hence, by Metonymy, a limit or bound, the limiis osa city.
