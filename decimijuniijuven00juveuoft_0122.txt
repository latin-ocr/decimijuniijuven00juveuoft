114 NOTES.

bling carried on with such spirit ?’—Neque . . . ανειὶ .· gaming is
carried to such an extent that they are not content to play for
what can be carried in their purses, but they stake whole chests
of money at a time.

83. Illic.- ‘there, among the gamesters.’—-Di'spensatore . . .
armigero .· the armigeri were servants, who followed their mas÷
ters, bearing their arms when they went to battle. ‘ The stew-
ard being armor-bearer,' that is, carrying for their masters money
and every thing necessary sor gambling.

&L Simplexnesicror .· ‘is it not more than madness ἴθ’-δεπεν-
tia centnm: ‘a hundred thousand sestertii :’ about 33570. See
Adam's Lat. Gram., p. 289.

85. Hora-enti : ‘shivering with coms—Reddere : for the simple
dara—He licre censures those gamblers who had rather lose an
immense sum than supply their families with the necessaries of
life.

86. Quis totidem .· se. avus—Quis . . . avus: ‘ which of our
ancestors ever supped in private on seven dishes.' The ancient
Roman nobles, to display their munificence, were in the habit of
giving costly entertainments to their friends and dependants ε
but the rich men oflatter times excluded them, and sat down to
sumptuous entertainments, provided for themselves alone.

87. Sportula .· this was ‘a little basket’ or pannier, made of a

bushels, at the outer gate.

88. Parva: as containing only a trifle of one hundred far-
things, or as implying, that the dole was every (lay diminished in
valna—Tarm . . . togatae : the common people were called turba
togata, from the gowns (toga) they wore.— In the times of the Cae-
Sars, the toga. was not in general use, and it was scarcely ever worn
then, except by the poorest and lowest of the Roman people.

69. Ille.- Ruperti understands this as applying to the sordid
rich man himself, and not, as most suppose, to the steward of the
man who distributed the dole.-Et trepidat : lest the dole should
be given to an impostor.

91. Agnitus : ‘recognised as one of his clients.'

92. Ipsos Trqjugcnas .· ‘the very descendants ofAEneas) The
poet now inveighs against many of the Roman nobility, who
were so mean as to scramble among the poor for these donations.
The word ipsos makes the sarcasm the stronger.

93. Da . . . tribuno .· these words we may suppose spoken by
the rich man to his steward3 or we may understand them as
spoken by these officers themselves—“Give to me the proetor,
&c.‘’—Praet0ri .· the praetor was the chief magistrate of the city,
and had the power of judging matters of law between the citi-
