been either Cinnamus, or Licinius, the freedman and barber of
Augustus—Gravis . . . mihi.- ‘troublesome to me, a youth?

26. Quum . . . Crispinus .· ‘ when Crispinus, one of the lowest
of the Egyptians, once a Canopian slave.'—Canopi.· acity of
Egypt¹ addicted to all manner of debanchery.

27. Cris inus : from a slave, he had been made master of the
horse to Nigra—Tyrias . . . lacernas .· the Romans used to fasten
their cloaks (lacerna) round the neck with a loop. Crispinus wore
his so loose, that he is here described as raising it up with his
shoulders.——Tyrias : ‘ dycd with Tyrian purple 3’ which was very
expenswe.

28. Ventilet . . . aarum : the Romans arrived at such a height
of luxury, that they wore large and heavy rings in winter, but
lighter ones in summer. The effeminate Egyptian is here repre-
sented as ‘ waving to and sro ' (ventilo) his hand in the air, to cool
his fingers (or, more probably, to display his ring), on one of which
he wore a summer ring.

29. Majom . . . gemmae .· ‘ of a larger size,’ that is, ‘a winter

critics are divided about the man, who followed Matho. The old
Scholiast says it was Heliodorus, the Stoic, who informed against
L. Junius Silanus, Massa, and Carus3 others, that it was Egna-
tius Celer, a Stoic philosopher, who, by false testimony, ruined his
friend and pupil, Bareas Soranus: but more probably i't was M.
Regulus, mentioned by Pliny, who carried on the trade of inform-
er under Nero and Domitian. Or, perhaps, the poet did not al-
lude to one informer, but to severat-Magni amici.- this means
either that the informer was in the employ of some distinguished
friend, for instance the Emperor, or that he had laid information
against some illustrious friend of himself, or of the Emperor.

34. Comcsti: robbed and destroyed by secret accusations, or
pillaged by informers for hush-money.

35. ,Massa .· ,Massa Bebius, an infamous informer.

36. Carus : Metius Carus, another informer, who bribed Regu-
lus to avoid some secret accusation.·—Tl13flnele . . . Latino .-
Thymele was the wife of Latinus, a famous inimic 3 she was ‘ sent
privately’ by her husband and prostituted to Regulus, to avoid
some information which Latinus dreaded.

38. Quum . . . prostantis : he now satirizes such guardians as
