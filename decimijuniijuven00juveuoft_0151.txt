JUV. SAT. IV 143

15. AEquaulem . . . libris .- i. e. weighing six poundS‚—it eost
him a sestertium, a pound.

Three pounds was about the usual weight of this fish, and it
was rarely found larger.

10. Ut perhibent .· as the flatterers of Crispinus give out3 they
probably represented the fish to be twice as large as it really was,
as some excuse for his extravagance.

18. Proecipuam . . . ceram . . . abstulit: ‘ he had become the
principal heir.'—-It was customary for wills to consist of two parts:
the first named the primi haeredes, chief heirS, and was therefore
called cera proecipua‚ because the tabletS‚ on which they wrote,
being of wood, were covered with wax .- the second named the
secundi haeredes, lesser heirs, and was called cera secunda.—Oth-
ers think that cera means the seal.

19. Ratio ulterior: ‘further teason‚’ to excuse his extrava-

trance.
e, 20. Latis specularibus .· ‘ with large windows.'—-—The specularis
lapis was a stone, clear like glass, cut into small thin panes, and
in old times used for glass, The largest panes were of course
the most costly.-—.Hntro .- ‘ litter—or sedan.'

22. Apicius.- a noted glutton in the time of Nero. Even Api-
cius, the poet intimates‚ was a srugal man in comparison with
this gormandizer.—-Hoc tu : sc. fecisti—Hoc . . . papyro .- i. e.
you who were formerly brought from Egypt to Rome, a vile slave,
and then clad in papyrus; this was a kind of flag, growing on
the banks of the river Nile, of which ropes, mats, and mean cloth-
ing were made.—Or more probably his clothes were tied on him
with cords made of this weed. Sat. Ι, 26, 27.

24. Squamae: this means the scales of fish, but put here by
Synecdoche for the fish itself.

25. Provincia . . . vendit .- ἰ. e. the price of this fish would pur-
chase an estate in some of the provinces, but in Apulia quite an
extenswe one. ·

26. Appulia .- Ruperti thinks this word should be written thus,
as the first syllable of Apulia is short in Hor„ Od. ΙΙΙ, 24, 4, and
in other passages. Most of the texts, however, have Apulia,
considering the first syllable common.

28. Endoperatorem: sor imperatorem ‚· if Crispinus, a court-
buffoon, paid so much for what formed but a small part ofa pri—
vate meal for himself, what must the emperor’s expenso be to sat-
isfy his gluttony [vl—Quum . . . siluros ι quum Crispinus purpureus
scurra magni palati, jam princeps equilum (i. e. non magister
equitum, sed inter equites illustres relatus), qui solebat, 850„ ructarit
tot sesterffa, exiguam partem et sumptam de margine modicae
coenoe.

32. Municipes . . . siluros: siluri were fish of small value of
the same country with Crispinus, i. e. from Egypt—Priola:
‘ fried-dried-or cured.’

The following is the note of Ruperti upon fricta dc merce.-
