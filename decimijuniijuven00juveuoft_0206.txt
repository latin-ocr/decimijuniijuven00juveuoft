268. Croesum . . . vitre .· Croesus was the last king of Lydia and
proverbially rich. He asked Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, who
was the happiest man Ρ The philosopher told him, ‘⁶ no man could
be called happy before death.'’ This afterwards Croesus found
to -be true; for being taken by Cyrus and ordered to be burned,
he cried out, “ Solon ! Solon! Solon !” Cyrus asked the reason
of this and was told what Solon had remarked : whereupon, con-
sidering, it might be his own case, he spared his life and treated
him with much respect.

270. Exsilium . . . habuere .· the long life of C. ,Μανίιιε was

Africa, he was obliged to beg his bread through the streets of
Carthage. He afterwards returned to Rome, on the departure

consequences of a civil war.

who wish so anxiously for beauty in their children.
