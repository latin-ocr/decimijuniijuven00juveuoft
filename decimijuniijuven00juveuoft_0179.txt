ων. SAT. vr. 171

490. Ιηιίὲ .· i. e. from these philtreS.

402. Avunculus . . . salivd: Coesar Caligrla, whom his wife
Caesonia drenched with a love potion, made of the hippomanes,
(a little skin or piece of flesh, taken from the forehead of a. solt
newly foaled,) which drove him into raving rnadness.

This potion of Caesonia was intinitely worse than Agrippina&
musshroom, for that only destroyed a drivelling old e1nneror3 but
Caligula, after his dranght, became a merciless and bloody tyrant.

499. Senis .· the emperor Claudius, who was poisoned by Agrip-
pina, his wife, in the sixty-fourth year of his age.

503. Partus equas: i. e. the colt, from which the hippomanes
was taken.

504. Pelliee .· pellea: properly denotes the kept mistress osa
married man. ·

511. Fingimus . . . hiatu .- i. e. what I have been saying must
appear so monstrous, as to be regarded by some as a fiction: and
instead of keeping within the bound and laws of satire, Ι have
taken a flight into the fabulous rant of tragedy, like Sophocles
and other tragic writers. “

515. Pontia: there were two women of this name, one was
the wife of vectius Bolanus, a man of high rank and estimation
who poisoned her two children (they were twins) in the time 'oie
Nero : the other, to whom the poet particularly alludes, was the
wife of Drymio, whose family took care to perpetuute her crime
(as Grangaeus says) by the following inscription on her tomb:
Pontia, Titi Pontii filia, hic sita sum, φατὲ, duobus ¹natis a me ve-
neno consumptis avaritiae opus, miser& mihi mortem conscivi. Tu,
quisquis es, qui hac transis, si pins es, quoeso α me oculos averte.

529. Sana .· ‘in her sound mind ;’--ι in cold blood.'

534. Hoc . . . refert .· this is the only difference between Cly—
taemnestra and the Roman ladies3 she, in a rude and simple
manner, with an axe, raisedin both her hands, slew her husband:
these, with greater shrewdness and cunning, by administering
secret doses of poison, effect the same object—Tyndaris illa :
‘ that daughter of Tyndarus‚'—Clytaemnestra.

Juvenal, by the manner of expression, illa Tyndaris, insinuates,
that this name belonged to others, viz, to many of the Roman
ladies of his time.

537. Atrides .· Agamemnon, the son os Atreus, and husband of
Clytaemnestra. Juvenal uses this name as descriptive of the
situation of the husband, whom the modern Clytaemnestra. is de-
termined to murder, for the sake of a gallant.

5:38. Pontica . . . regis .· Mithridates, a king of Pontus, invent.-
ed a medicine, called Mithridate, an antidote against poison„
