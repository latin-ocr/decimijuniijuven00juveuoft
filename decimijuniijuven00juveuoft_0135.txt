SAT-IRE III.

Umbricius, an Aruspex, and a friend of Juvenal, disgusted at
the prevalence of vice, and total disregard of unassuming virtue,
is introduced on the point of quitting Rome for Cumae. The poet
accompanies him some little way from the city, when the honest
exile, no longer able to suppress his indignation, acquaints him
with the causes of his retirement.

What he says may be arranged under the following heads‚--
that Flattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome 3 that
in these, particularly the first, foreigners have a manifest superi-
ority over the natives, and consequently engross all fax 0r3 that
the poor are universally exposed to scorn and insult3 that the
general habits of extravagance render it difficult‘ for them tos s-ub
sist3 and that a crowded capital subjects them to numberless m-
conveniences unknown in the country: he then again adverts to
the peculiar sufferings of the poorer citizens from the want of a
well regulated police, these he illustrates by a variety of exam-
ples, and concludes in a strain of pathos and beauty, which winds
up the whole with singular effect.

This Satire is imitated by Smollet in his description of London
‚and Bath, διο.

friend ;' i. e. Umbricius.

2. Vacuis . . . Cumis .· Cumae, a maritime city of Campania, not
far from Puteoli, and famous for the cave and shrine of the Cu-
moean Sibyl. The poet calls it empty (vacuis) iu comparison with
the populousness of Rome.
