SATIRE IV.

Juvenal, in this Satire‚ indulges his honest indignation against
Crispinus and his employer Domitian.

After describing some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the
poet makes a sudden transition to his extravagance and gluttony,
and thereby takes occasion to describe a ridiculous consultafion,
held by Domitian over a turbot, which was too large to be con-
tained in any dish, that could be found. After a long delibera-
tion among the senators, it was proposed, that the fish should be
cut in pieces and thus cooked 3 but at last the opinion of the sen-
ator Montanus prcvailed, that it should be dressed whole, and that
a dish, large enough to contain it, should be made expressly for
the purpose of receiving it.

The council is then dismissed, and the Satire concludes with a
most severe censure on the emperor’s cruelty and injustice to-
wards some of the best and most worthy of the Romans.

1. Iterum Crispinus: Crispinus has been mentioned before in
Sat. Ι, 27.

2. Ad partes: a metaphor, taken from the players, who, when
they had finished the scene they were to act, retired‚ but were
called again to resume their parts, until the piece was finished.

3. AEger : ‘ enervated ς’ infirm both in mind and body.

4. Quid refert .· i. e. what signifies how rich he is, since no bad
man can be happy D—chmcntasat-iget: in riding through his mag-
nificent portiones. It was a part of the Roman luxury to build
vast porticoes in their gradem, under which they rode in wet or
hot weather.

.-

o. Quanta . . . umbrd: the rich and luxurious Romans were
also carried in sedans through shady groveS, in sultry weather.

which was near the centre of the city, were the most valuable.

The Vestal virgins made a vow of perpetual chastity ; ifany broke
this vow, by a law of Numa Pompilius, their founder, they were
buried alive.

10. Alter : any other than Crispinus would have been punished
by Domitian, whom the poet ironically calls judex morum.

19. Titio Seio .· these were fictitious personages, whose names
were inserted in all law-processes.

13. Quid agas: this seems to depend upon the loth verse:
we are now speaking of his smaller crimes, yet what can you do
or say, &c.? what hc is is so much worse than what he does, that
one is at a loss how to treat him.

14. Mullum .· probably the fish called red mullet or harbel.—
Sex millibus.- sc. ‘nummorum ‚· 6000 sestertii (about 3214).
