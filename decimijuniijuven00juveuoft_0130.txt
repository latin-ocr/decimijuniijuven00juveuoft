of adultery, to pull off the stola or woman's germem, and put on
the toga or man’s garment, which stigmatized them as infamous3
but even this was not so infamous as the transparent dress of
the judge.—Sed . . . aestuo .· the words of the judge, to excuse
his appearance in such a dress.

54. Nudus . . . impis .· the answer of the poet—Nudus.- i. e.

sold vestitus tzmicd5 like 71131111'13 in Greek—Agas- .· ‘administer
'ustice.’
J 55. En . . . aratris .· the answer of Creticus, ridiculing the ob-
jections made to his own appearance.——The dress you would have
me assume is so ridiculous, that if, dressed in a tunic alone, you
should present yourself in the judgment-seat, the people, recent-
ly victorious, whose wounds are scarcely healed, and the rough
inountaineers, leaving their rustic labors, would flock around you
through desire of hearing and seeing you.—This is the explana-
tion given by Ruperti.-—Most interpreters understand the pas-
sage as expressive of the indignation of the poet at having so
effeminate ajudge in office.

58. Quid . . . testem .· the answer of the poet 3—you say what
is right, Creticus, but how much more would one be astonished at
seeing a judge dressed as you are3 your dress would disgrace
a witness, much more a judge.

61. Dedit . . . labem : i. e. you owe all this effeminacy to the
company you have kept3 by this you have been infected.

64. Uva . . . ab uvd .· a proverbial expression from the ripen-
ing of the black grape, which has a blue or lix-id color: the grapes
do not assume this hue all at once, but one after the other; which
the vulgar suppose was owing to the grapes looking upon each
other, and thus contracting the same color.

A proverbial expression of a similar ki‘nd is found in many lan-
guages. “ One plum gets color by looking at another,'' is said to
be a common phrase in Persia, to signify the propagation of an
opinion, custom, διε.

66. Accipient te: the poet now exposes a set of unnatural
wretches, who, in imitation of women, celebrated the mysteries
os the Bona Dea or Good Goddess, who was a Roman lady, the
wife osone Faunus, and famous for her chastity 3 after her death
she was consecrated. Sacrifices were performed to her only by
night and secretly3 to her was sacrificed a sow pig. At these
rites none but women were admitted.

At the new institution, of which the poet is now speaking, no
females were admitted.

68. „Monilia .· ⁴ necklaces 3' these were peculiar to females;
but the wretches‚ spoken of here, assumed not only the dresses
and ornaments of females, but also, that they might resemble
women as much as possible, went *through the same rites and
ceremonies.
