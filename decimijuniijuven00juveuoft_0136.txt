128 NOTES.

3. Unum Sibyllae.- Umbricius was now about bestowing him-
aelf as a citizen to Cumoe, in taking up his residence there.

4. ,Ianua Baiarum: passengers from Rome to Baiae (a de-
hghtful ,city of Campania, celebrated for its warm springs, and
frequented by the nobility of Rome, many of whom had villas
'there fo'r their summer residence) were obliged to pass through
Curnae: they went in on one side and carne out on the other, as
through a gate.— Gratum . . . secessus .· the shore from Cumae to
Baiae was exceedingly pleasant and calculated for the most agree-
able retirement. Baiae forms part of the bay of Naples.

5. Prochytam: a small rugged island in the Tyrrhenian sea,
near the Cape of Misenum, rugged and desert—Suburae .· ‘ Rome ς’
Subura was one of the principal streets of Rome, but frequented
by the vulgar.

G. Νάηι quid . . . poetas .· i. e. what place in the world is there
so wretched and desert, that it would not be better to live there
than at Rome ? ,

7. Lapsus tectorum .· ‘falling of honses,’ owing to the little care
taken of old and ruinous buildings.

10. Tota domus.- i. e. his family and furniture. Juvenal in-
sinuates the poverty and frugality of his friend Umbricius,
whose entire household furniture was packed up in a single
wagon.

11. Substitit: we must imagine that Umbricius, attended by
Juvenal, walkcd out before the wagon, and having gone to a cer-
tain distance, stood still to wait the arrival of the vehicle. Here
he tells the poet his various reasons for leaving Rome, which are
so many strokes of the keenest satire upon the vices and follies
of its inhabitants—Veteres arcus : the ancient triumphal arches
of Romulus3 or those erected to the memory of the. Horatin or
more probably tho old arches of the aqueduct might here be
meunt, and hence the epithet nzadida112.—sssasliilamque Capenam t
Capena porta was one of the gates of the city that led to Capua .-
it was also called Fontinalis from the aqueduct near it.

12. Hic.- in a grove near the gate Capena.—N‘uma.· Pompili-
us, the successor of Romulus—Nocturna& . . . amicae .· Numa, the
more strongly to recommend his laws and insti] into the Romans
a reverence for religion, persuaded them that he made nightly
appointments with the goddess Egeria (whom Juvenal humor-
ously calls his nocturnal mistress, as if describing an intrigue), and
that from hor mouth he received his whole form of government.
In the grove where they met was a temple sacred to the Muses
and to this goddess, whose fountain watered the grove 3 for it is
fabled that she wept herself into a fountain from grief at the death
of Numa.

The fountain, grove, and temple were let out at a yearly rent
to the Jews, who together with the Christians were banished from
the city by Domitian.

13. Delubra .· the difference between templum and delubrum is,
