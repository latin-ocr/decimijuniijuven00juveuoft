JUV. SAT. xm. 207

117. Iphigenia .· this alludes to the story of Agamemnon sacri—
ficing his daughter Iphigenia. See Class. Dict.

118. Tragicae . . . cervae: alluding to Diana's stealing away
Iphigenia and substituting the hina in her place.

120. [libitinam evaserit: ‘should recover.’ Libitina was a
name given to Proserpine‚ as presiding over funerals.

123. Breviter.- i. e. in a few words; like exiguis tabulis in
Sat. I, 60, which see.

125. Jugulata Mycenis .· ‘Iphigenia sacrificed at Mycenae.’—
If Agamemnon had not offered to sacrifice his daughter, Pacu-
vius would never have thought of doing the same with his, for
the recovery of the rich man, who, in consequence, has made
him heir to his whole estate.

126. Vel Nestora totum .· ‘ even to Nestor's age.’

127. Quantum . . . Nero .· the rapacity of Nero was proverbial.
The sums he extorted from the provinces under various pretences
exceed all belief. -

He gave no office, says Suetonius, without the addition of this
special charge: ‘⁴ Scis quid mihi opus sit ‚· et hoc agamus, ne quis
quidquam habeat.” Yon know what I want; let us managein
such a manner, that nobody else may have any thing.

SATIRE XIII.

Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confiden-
tial person ς when the restoration of this was demanded, the man,
to whom it had been entrusted‚ foreswore the deposit.

The indignation, expressed by Calvinus at this breach of trust,
seems to have reached the ears of his friend Juvenal, who en-
deavors to soothe and comfort him under his loss : in doing this,
the poet speaks of the villany of the times, shows that nothing
can happen, but by the will of Providence, and that wicked men
carry with them their own punishment.

4. Gratia . . . urna: in criminal cases, the Praetor Urbanus,
who sat as chief judge, put into an urn the names of his as-
sessors (a kind of jury-men, who, to the amount of some hun-
dreds, were annually chosen for this purpose), from which he
drew out the number prescribed by law, usually about fisty, who
sat by him at the trial. When the pleadings were over, they re-
tired and deliberated on what had passed. On their return, they
had each three waxen tablets put into their hands, one of which
was marked with the letter C, sor condemno, guilty3 another,
with the letter A, for absolvo, not guilty3 and a third, with the
letters N L, non liquet, I am doubtful. One of these tablets,
, each person dropped privately into an urn, which the praetor took
out, and pronounced sentence, according to the decision of the
majority.
