THE SATIRES OF PERSIUS.

Annus Pnnsms Fucens was born at Volaterrae, a town of
Etruria, A. D. 34. His father was of Equestrian rank, and died
when his son was about six years of age. Persius studied at
Volaterrae, until he had attained his twelfth year: after that he
was removed to Rome, and placed under the care of Palaemon, a
grammarian, and Verginius Flaccus, a rhetorician. At the age of
sixteen, he was placed under the tuition of Annaeus Cornutus, a
Stoic philosopher, to whom the fifth Satire is addressed, and in
whose praise it is written. During the reign of Nero, Persius
distinguished himself for his satiric compositions, in which he did
not even spare the emperor himself. He died at his estate, near
Rome, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, in the consulship of
Rubrius Marius and Asinius Gallus.

 

hiThe arguments or designs of the six satires are contained in
t s verse: ⁴

Of poets, wishes, idleness and health,
The statesman‚ sreedom, avarice and wealth.

PROLOGUE.

Persius, after the manner of dramatic writers, prefaces his
Satires with a prologue in Iambie verse. This kind of Iambic
verse is called scazon, and requires an iambus in the fifth and a
spondee in the sixth place: an iambus, spondeo, dactyle, tri-
brac, and anapest are admissible in the first four places: thus,

Nec fon· Ι te lii- Ι bra pro- Ι lui Ι cabal— Ι lino.
Hederae Ι sequa· Ι ces ip· Ι se se· Ι mipa- Ι ganas.
corvos poe· Ι tas et Ι poe· Ι trias Ι picas.

Canta· re cre· Ι dtis Pe· Ι gase· Ι ium Ι nectar.
