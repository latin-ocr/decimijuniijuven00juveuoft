190 NOTES.

108. Qui . . . caput .· by this periphrasis are described those un-

SATIRE X.

The subject of this Satire is the Vanity of Human WVishes.
The poet takes his stand on the great theatre of the world and
summons before him the illustrious characters of 311 ages. As
they appear in succession, he shows, from the principal events “
of their lives, how little happiness is promoted, by the attainment
of what our indis-tinet and bounded views represent, as the most
perfect of earthly blessings. Of these he instances walth,
power, eloquence, military glory, and persona] accomplishments3
all which have, as he observes, proved dangerous or destructive
to their respective possessors. From hence, he argues the wis-
dom of acquiescing in the dispensations of Heaven; und con-
cludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out, with great
force and beauty, the objects for which a rational being may pre—
sume to approach the Almighty.

Juvenal seems, in the composition of this satire, to have had
in his thoughts Plato’s second dialogue of Alcibiades and Per-
sius's second Satire ; he has, however, taken nothing from them,
but the general idea 3 the filling up is entirely his own.

1. Gadibus: Gades, now cadiz, is an island beyond the straits
of Gibraltar, to the south of Spain. The ancients supposed it to
be the extremity os the west whence the inscription, NJ: PLus
Umm, on the pillars of Hercules.

2. Gangen .· the greatest river in the east, dividing India into
two partS.
