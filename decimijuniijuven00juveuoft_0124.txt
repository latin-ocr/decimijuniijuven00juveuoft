116 NOTES.

111. Comites : ‘the chemy-Hinc .· ‘ from hence,’ that is, from
the dole they receive.

112. Primusque dorni .· ‘ the smoke of the house 3’ satirically for
the ‘green wood,' which the poor were compelled to buy, as being
the cheapest, and which filled their houses with an abundance of
smoke.—Densz'ssima . . . lectica : ‘ a very thick crowd of litters.’

113. Quadi-antes .- the quadrans was the fourth part of an as,
worth about one third of a cent3 a hundred of these were put
into the sportula or dole-basket..—Sequitur . . . uror.- the hus-
band carries about his sick wife to claim her share.

115. Hic . . . sellam .- another brings an empty litter.

117. Galla . . . est.- addressed by the husband to the dole dis-
tributor.

118. Proser . . . caput .· ⁴ put your· head out ofthe litter‚’ that I
may see if you are there 3 says the dispenser of the dole.—Noli
. . . quiescit: the answer of the husband.

119. Ipse dies .- the poet, having satirized the avarice of the
higher sort, now ridicules the idle manner in which they spent
their time.

120. Sportula: sc. petilian—Forum: the place where courts
ofjustice were held: the ‘ third forum' is meant, which was built
. by Augustus, and-adorned with an ivory statue of Apollo, called
here juris peritus, from the constant pleadings of the lawyers.

121. Triumphales .- the statues of eminent persons, who had
triumphed over the enemies of the state 3 these were placed in
the sorum of Augustus, and in other public parts of the city.

122. Arabarches .· ‘ Arabian prefect 3’ Pompey is thus called by
Cicero3 but some infamous person is here alluded to, who had
been prefect over Arabia, and had by extoruon returned to
Rome with great riches, and in consequence of his wealth a
statue was erected to him, as to the Egyptian mentioned in this
verse, who is supposed by some to have been in a similar situa-
tion in Egypt.

127. Rex horum : ‘ the patron of these clients ς’ rex· not only sig-
nifies a king, but any great or rich man.-Vacuis . . ,jacebas the
Roman men, at their meals, lay on couches, the women sat on
chairs3 several of these couches are here supposed to be placed
round the table formerly occupied by the friends and clients of
the rich man, but they are now vacant3 the selfish glutton alone
partakes of the splendid entertainment.

128. Orbibus .· some understand this to mean ‘ circular dishes ;’
others ‘ tables,' which were at first made square, but afterwards
of a round form.

129. Umi mensa : ‘ at a single meal 3’ or, perhaps, more proper-
ly, ‘ at a single course.' Servius, on Virg. AEn. I. 740, remarks,
that the tables were brought in with the dishes upon them, and
not the dishes brought in to be placed upon the table. The first
table (prima mensa) was covered with meats, διας the second
(secunda mensa) with fruit.
