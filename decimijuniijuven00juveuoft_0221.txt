198. Testem .· the testimony of an evil conscience.

199. Spartano . . . propinquis .- the poet alludes to a story re-
lated by Herodotus. A Milesian had entrusted a sum of money
to one Glaucus, a Spartan. After a time, the sons of the Mile-
sian came to re-demand it. Glaucus affirmed, that he had no
recollection of the circumstance and sent them away. As soon
as they were gone, he hastened to Delphi, to inquire if he should
persist in denying it: he was answered that, if he foreswore the
money, he might escape for a time, but, for his wicked design, he
and all his family should be utterly destroyed. Upon this, Glau-
cus sent for the Milesians and paid them the whole sum: but
what the oracle foretold came to paSS, for he and all his kindred
were afterwards extirpated. Herod. VI, 86.

214. Albam· .· Alban wine was very much esteemed.

or in sickness to engage by vow some offering to the godS, on
their deliverance or recovery.

233. Laribus . . . audent .· the Lares were the private gods of
individuals. A cock was sacrificed to AEseulapius after recovery.

Madan thus understands the sentence: “ So far from promising
a cock to AEsculapius, they have not the courage to vow even a
cock’s comb,” διο. ⁴

245. Uncum .· a chain, the links of which were called unci or
hanni.

Some understand a hook in the wall, to which the malefactor
was chained.

here, inasmuch as carcere is in this place joined with it.

248. Nominis .- here used for hominis.

249. Nec surdum nec Tiresiam .- ‘neither deas nor blind.’-
