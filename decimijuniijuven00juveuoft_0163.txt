SATIRE VI.

This is not only the longest, but the most complete of our au-
thor’s works. With respect to his other Satires, some of them
are distinguished by one excellence, and some by another3 but
in this he has combined them all. Forcible in argument, flowing
in diction, bold, impassioned, and sublime 3 it seems as if the poet
had risen with 1115 theme, and, conscious of its extent, taxed all
his powers to do it justice.

The whole of this Satire is abitterinvective against the female
sex, and the poet endeavors to dissuade his friend Ursidius Pos-
tumus from marriage, at the expense of the whole sex.

It would seem, from internal evidence, that this Satire was
written under Domitian. It has few politica} allusions ; and

and caves of the mountains.

7. Cynthia: mistress to the poet Propertius, her true name
was Hostia.-—Nec tibi . . . ocellos: alluding to Lesbia, mistress of
Catullus, whose true name was Claudia; she bewailed much the
death os 111 sparrow5 on 11115 subject Catullus wrote an elegy.

9. Ροίαηάα... . magnis: according to Hesiod, in the golden
age, men were accounted infants, and under the care of their
mother, till near a hundred years old. Potanda well suits this
idea. for men might rather be said to drinlc than to suek.
